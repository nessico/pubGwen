## Features

> E-Commerce full-stack application built on .NET and Angular, deployed on AWS

- Login and registration form with Angular Reactive forms
- Employees are publicly visible, can manage their profile, upload photos of their work, like other users, and message each other
- Customers are privately hidden, are able to save items, and purchase items
- Store with baskets, orders, and checkouts
- Pagination, sorting, and filtering for store items and employees with IQueryables

## Tech

- PayPal API for payment processing
- Cloudinary API for media management
- SignalR API for real-time online presence, live chat, and notifications
- Fluent API and AutoMapper to map table references and relationships
- Rxjs and tokens in local storage for client persistence along with caching to optimize performance and mapping observables with pipe
- Redis for in-memory cache to store customer basket
- AWS EC2 linux instance for deployment , AWS RDS for database, AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline for CI/CD pipeline
- Angular and BootStrap modules for styling, e.g. toastr, ngx-bootstrap
- MS SQL Server for database management -> migrated to PostGreSQL PgAdmin for deployment costs

--

- Identity and Role Management using ASPNET.Identity with hashed and salted passwords for users
- JWT for user authentication, SSL to encrypt incoming user information
- Angular route/auth guards, client-side form validation along with async API validators, API-side data annotations validation, DTOs to encapsulate properties from client
- etc...

## Architecture

> Follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and SOLID principles:

Adhered to Microsoft`s Clean Architecture:

| Layer          | Description                                                   | Dependency                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API            | handles HTTP requests and responses                           | infrastructure layer, transitive dependency on the core layer |
| Infrastructure | queries database, contains data migrations, repositories, etc | core layer                                                    |
| Core           | contains business models, entities, etc                       | none                                                          |

## Design Patterns

Implemented design patterns:

| Pattern             |Where  | Description                                                                  | 
| --------------------| -| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Singleton            | API & Client| |
| Repository           |  API |Allows changing between domain model and database model independently, which is great for code maintenance|
| Unit Of Work         | API                                                                          ||
| Observable           | Client  |Manages async data, Can use Rxjs Operators and Async pipe, etc  before subscribing|
| ?                    |                        |Http Client|
| service locator      | API    ||
| Dependency Injection | API & Client                                                               |Achieves Inversion of Control (IoC) to reduce coupling which helps with isolating design changes to the client to promote reuseable, testable, and clean code.|
| Promise              |  Client   | async send message in message.service.ts cant sub to a promise|
| Specification        | API|GenericRepository with Specification pattern to avoid leaky abstractions|
| Dto        |    API   |Enterprise application architecture pattern to serialize, encapsulate, validate, model data  |

## Install

```sh
install a Redis docker developer with
	docker run --name redisdev -d -p 6379:6379 redis
install a PostgreSQL docker developer server with
	docker run --name dev -POSTGRES-USER=appuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=PA$$W0RD -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
1st terminal: cd into API folder and type: dotnet run
2nd terminal: cd into client folder and type: ng serve
use https://localhost:4200 in your preferred browser
