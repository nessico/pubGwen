### Architecture and Design Patterns
> Follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and SOLID principles 

+ Adhered to Microsoft`s Clean Architecture:
	+ API - handles HTTP requests and responses
		- has dependency on infrastructure layer, therefore has a transitive dependency on the core layer
	+ Infrastructure - queries the database and contains our data migrations, repositories, etc
		- has dependency on core layer
	+ Core - contains business models, entities, etc
		- does not depend on anything
		

`I did this to make my app extensible, easier to maintain, read, and update`
		
![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/media/image5-7.png)

<p>
</p>
+ Implemented the following design patterns:

	singleton  - client 
repository pattern - api
unit of work pattern - api
observable pattern - client  for async pipe , use $ at end of varname to identify it as 
pattern - HTTP client
service locator pattern - api
dependency injection pattern - api & client
promise pattern - client async sendmessage in message.service.ts cant sub to a promise
Generic Repository with Specification pattern to avoid leaky abstractions
Specification pattern
etc...
